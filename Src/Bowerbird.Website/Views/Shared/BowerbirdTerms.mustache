  <h2>&quot;New information does not become science until it is made social.&quot; – E.O. Wilson.</h2>

  <p>BowerBird is offered as a social, web-based, biological sandpit – where everyone can come and play.</p>
  <p>It will be fun to add an observation, see it be recognised, commented on and identified or that find that it contains unknown information about a species; and, then to see the observation become part of a larger picture for a species or ecosystem and finally to have the observation information integrated with national and international databases.</p>
  <p>More formally, it is a socially networked, web-based, community, biodiversity workspace for Australia, although anyone is welcome to participate.  We hope that it will be used by individuals, citizen scientists, amateur and professional science-based Organisations and Societies and Field Naturalists clubs. Its strength will be a single point of entry for biological communication and sharing.</p>

  <p>The primary aims of BowerBird are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>To share and deliver biological observations to a broad audience</li>
    <li>To allow local, state or national groups to form, manage and develop their own workspaces</li>
    <li>To encourage comment and forum discussions on observations or topics</li>
    <li>To aggregate a minimum dataset (eg. Name, location, latitude/longitude)  that will allow observations to be shared nationally and internationally (ALA, GBIF, EOL etc)</li>
    <li>To become the community’s eyes for Biosecurity that will detect or monitor invasive species.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We will provide the workspace, the tools and the infrastructure to achieve these community and society based goals.</p>
  <p>The website development was funded by Museum Victoria (MV), Melbourne Australia and Atlas of Living Australia (ALA), CSIRO, Canberra.  The primary programmers were Frank Radocaj and Hamish Crittenden and the project was managed by Ken Walker (MV).  Ongoing support for BowerBird will be provided by MV and ALA.</p>
