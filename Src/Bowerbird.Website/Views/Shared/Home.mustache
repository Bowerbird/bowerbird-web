  <h2>Hello {{Model.User.FirstName}}, welcome to Bowerbird!</h2>
  <p>Now that you have joined, please take the time to have a look at the introduction to familiarise yourself with Bowerbird.</p>

  <h3>Projects</h3>
  <p>
    A project is a group of people with a common goal or interests in making observations. You will find lots of projects you can join by clicking the Projects link above. 
  </p>
  <h3>Observations</h3>
  <p>
    An observation is a record of something you have seen. It consists of a title, a combination of photos, video and audio and a location. If you are a member of a project, you can add your observation to that project so that other members can view, discuss and identify your contribution. And that's just the start!
