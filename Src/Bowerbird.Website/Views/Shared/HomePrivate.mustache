  <h3>Projects</h3>

  <h3>Sightings</h3>
  <p>
    A sighting is an observation or a record of something you have seen. It consists of a title, a combination of photos, video and audio and a location. If you are a member of a project, you can add your observation to that project so that other members can view, discuss and identify your contribution. And that's just the start!
