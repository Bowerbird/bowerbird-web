Project Description
===================
Bowerbird is:
*	A social network without walls, closed doors or exclusivity; totally open, totally visible and totally collaborative
*	A continuous activity stream of natural history observations
*	A workspace tool for the Citizen Science as well as the Scientific Biodiversity and Biosecurity communities where individuals can form groups; communicate and collaborate; make, discuss and identify their observations.
*	An aggregator of observational data (specimen and images/video) and community comment into species pages with the added richness^ of interpretation from external sources (eg. ALA, GBIF, BHL, specimen data, mapping overlays: rainfall, climate, vegetation). Well this last part (^) is on the wishlist.
