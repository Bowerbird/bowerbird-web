  <em>BowerBird member discovers new worm species!</em>
  <p>
    Jean and Fred Hort uploaded a photo of a flatworm to BowerBird. A fellow BowerBird member who is an expert on flatworms identified it as a new species, as there were few flatworms known to the area. <a href="http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/new-worm-discovered-by-citizen-scientists.htm" target="new">Read more about the discovery at Australian Geographic</a>
